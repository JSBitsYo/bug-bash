## üìù Notes
Since this is a front-end focused debugging course, please focus only on the files in the `./static` folder. Some bugs are intentionally created server-side and are meant to be discovered on the client so resist the urger to peek in the `route.js` file. Or if you really want to, it's fine - go ahead!
